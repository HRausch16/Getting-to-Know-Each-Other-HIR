  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h2>
  <p style="text-align:center;">Hi, I'm Hannah! I'm originally from Joliet, IL. I graduated from Joliet Central High School, which is sometimes referred to as "the castle" in Downtown Joliet. I enjoy drawing, leatherworking, and going to the range. I used to shoot pellet rifles competitively in high school, and I still enjoy going to the range for fun target practice.
    I'm actually a self-taught leatherworker. It was quite the endeavor! I am an applied physics major, and I hope to become a scientific or research officer in the Air Force.

</p>

  <p style="text-align:center;">My family consists of me, my mom, my dad, my sister, and my two dogs. My mom is an administrative and operations assistant at BMO Harris Bank.
    My dad works as a lanscape estimator. My sister is nine and a half years older than me and lives in Iowa. I also have three nephews: Connor, Lennox, and Remmington.
    My two dogs are Ollie and Buster. They are littermates and have only been apart for a week in their lives. They are dachshund/pitbull terrier mixes.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">My Favorite Hobby</h2>
<p style="text-align:center; margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px;">My favorite hobby is leatherworking. As mentioned before, I am self-taught. I've been doing leatherworking since early high school. It was just one of those hobbies that I came across and thought was cool, so I decided to try it. I ended up loving it. I've made wallets, belts, keychains, and knife sheaths. My most recent project was actually making a knife sheath for a friend of mine. I'm not currently doing any leatherworking due to my school schedule, but I am planning on making a wallet for myself in the future.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Fun Fact</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">I play Dungeons & Dragons. I'm usually the dungeon master. Below is my dicebag that I made, Fafnir.</p>
